# Debugging notes: OV02C10 / Intel IPU6 on Debian

This documents the investigation behind this repo, for anyone hitting the
same wall on similar hardware (Dell XPS 16, OV02C10 sensor, Intel IPU6
image processor, mainline/Debian kernel — likely applicable to other
IPU6-based laptops too).

## The three candidate approaches, and why two are dead ends

1. **`libcamera` (via `cam`, `pipewire-libcamera`, etc.)** — sees the
   camera and can capture, but only through its `uncalibrated.yaml`
   fallback IPA, since no `ov02c10.yaml` tuning file has been upstreamed
   for this sensor. Symptom: `cam --list-controls` and captures work, but
   there is no real AGC (auto gain control) loop — frame 1 after stream
   start carries a valid image, every frame after it goes solid black.
   Root cause: `IPASoft: Failed to create camera sensor helper for
   ov02c10` — libcamera's software ISP has no registered
   `CameraSensorHelper` for this sensor model, so its blind AGC can't
   correctly convert between register gain values and real-world units,
   and drives exposure/gain to the floor. Fixing this properly means
   patching and rebuilding libcamera itself to add a sensor helper —
   possible, but a real C++ change, not a config tweak.

2. **Intel's proprietary HAL (`icamerasrc` / `libcamhal`, GStreamer)** —
   if it's already installed (`libcamhal-ipu6epmtl` /
   `gstreamer1.0-icamera`, likely pulled in as an Ubuntu OEM `.deb`, since
   Debian's own repos don't ship it), `gst-inspect-1.0 icamerasrc` will
   correctly detect the sensor by name (`ov02c10-uf`) and it *does* ship
   real per-module `.aiqb` tuning data under `/etc/camera/ipu6epmtl/`.
   It still fails, though:
   ```
   CamHAL[ERR] Failed to open PSYS, error: No such file or directory
   ```
   PSYS is the IPU6's hardware image processor (does debayer/3A in
   silicon). Check what's actually loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep -i ipu6
   find /lib/modules/"$(uname -r)" -iname "*ipu6*"
   ```
   On mainline/Debian kernels you'll typically find `intel-ipu6.ko` and
   `intel-ipu6-isys.ko` (capture-only) but **no `intel-ipu6-psys.ko`** —
   that driver only ships in Ubuntu's OEM-patched kernels or Intel's
   out-of-tree `ipu6-drivers` DKMS package. Getting this path working
   means building and maintaining an out-of-tree kernel module against
   your exact kernel version — real ongoing risk, breaks on every kernel
   update. Not worth it unless you have no other option.

3. **Raw V4L2 capture + software debayer (what this repo does)** — bypass
   both of the above. Open the ISYS capture node directly, pull raw
   packed-10-bit Bayer frames, debayer and gain-correct them in Python
   with numpy, and feed the result into a GStreamer `appsrc` pipeline.
   No PSYS, no libcamera IPA, no proprietary HAL. Slower and cruder than
   real ISP hardware, but it's the only path that doesn't depend on
   kernel modules you don't have.

## Bugs found and fixed in the raw-capture path

- **Stale hardcoded I2C bus number.** The sensor's media-controller entity
  name embeds its I2C bus (e.g. `ov02c10 5-0036`), and that bus number is
  **not stable across boots** — ACPI enumerates I2C devices in a
  different order depending on boot state. A hardcoded bus number will
  silently go stale (all `media-ctl` calls referencing it fail, but with
  `check=False` logging they don't loudly break anything). Resolve it
  live instead:
  ```bash
  media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -p | grep -i ov02c10
  ```
  `find_sensor_entity()` in `camera/ov02c10_camera/media_pipeline.py` does this automatically at
  every startup instead of hardcoding a bus number.

- **No exposure/gain control at all.** There's no AE/AGC loop anywhere in
  the raw V4L2 path — the sensor sits at whatever its driver's power-on
  defaults are. On this hardware that turned out to be `exposure` pinned
  at its **maximum** (2320/2320) with `analogue_gain` barely off the
  floor (20/248) and `digital_gain` at rock bottom (1024/16383) — i.e.
  a very dark raw signal with no compensating gain, even in a well-lit
  room. Check current values with:
  ```bash
  v4l2-ctl -d "$(media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -e 'ov02c10 5-0036')" -l
  ```
  `set_sensor_gain()` sets `analogue_gain`/`digital_gain` explicitly via
  `VIDIOC_S_CTRL` on the sensor subdevice before streaming starts. The
  defaults in this repo (`analogue_gain=150`, `digital_gain=4096`) were
  tuned for one indoor room and are a fixed value, not real auto-exposure
  — retune via `--analogue-gain`/`--digital-gain` if your lighting is
  very different.

- **CPU/memory blowup in the debayer step.** The original debayer
  upsampled half-resolution R/G/B channels all the way back up to *full*
  sensor resolution with `np.repeat` (six large temporary array
  allocations per frame, ~30MB/frame at 30fps) and then immediately threw
  most of it away downsampling to the actual output resolution. This
  pegged a CPU core and, combined with sustained large-block allocation
  churn, drove RSS into the tens of GB within seconds via allocator arena
  growth. Fixed by gathering directly from half-res to output resolution
  with a single indexed copy per channel — no full-resolution
  intermediate at all.

- **Per-frame `Gst.Buffer` leak.** `Gst.Buffer.new_wrapped(bytes(view))`
  called every frame ties a fresh Python `bytes` object to a new
  `GstBuffer` 30 times a second; in practice it was never being reclaimed.
  Switched to `Gst.Buffer.new_allocate()` + `.fill()`, which allocates
  from GStreamer's own memory pool and copies into it instead.

- **`free_device()` was killing the system's PipeWire multimedia service.**
  Every `make run` broke live audio/mic routing (discovered mid-Teams-call).
  The original implementation ran `fuser -k <device>` unconditionally to
  clear the capture node before opening it — but `fuser` reported
  `pipewire`/`wireplumber`'s PIDs as holding `/dev/video32` (WirePlumber
  keeps a brief monitoring/enumeration handle on camera devices as part of
  normal desktop media-session management, not an exclusive streaming
  lock), and `fuser -k` killed them along with everything else, taking the
  whole system's audio down with it. Fixed by checking each held-device
  PID's process name via `ps -o comm=` first and never killing
  `pipewire`/`wireplumber`/`pipewire-media-session` — only genuinely
  conflicting processes get killed now.

## Environment setup issues

- **Debian's packaged `v4l2loopback-dkms` can fail to build on newer
  kernels.** Trixie ships `v4l2loopback-dkms 0.15.0`, which fails against
  kernel `6.17.13` with:
  ```
  error: implicit declaration of function 'setup_timer'
  ```
  `setup_timer()` was removed from the kernel timer API; upstream
  `v4l2loopback` added a `#if defined(timer_setup)` compatibility branch
  to handle this, but that fix landed after the `0.15.0` release Debian
  packaged. Confirmed fixed as of upstream tag `v0.15.4`. `scripts/setup.sh`
  builds that version from source via DKMS instead of relying on the apt
  package, so it still auto-rebuilds on kernel upgrades like a normal DKMS
  module.

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gi'` when running via `uv run`/the
  systemd service, even though `python3 -c "import gi"` works fine.**
  PyGObject is installed via apt against the *system* Python
  (`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`) — it's a C-extension GObject
  Introspection binding, not something pip can build. `uv sync`/`uv venv`
  by default download and manage their own standalone CPython build
  (e.g. `~/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.14-...`), a completely
  separate interpreter installation. Setting `include-system-site-packages
  = true` in `pyvenv.cfg` doesn't help — it only adds *that interpreter's*
  site-packages dir, and uv's standalone build has nothing installed via
  apt. Fix: pin the venv to the actual system interpreter so
  system-site-packages correctly points at the dist-packages `gi` is
  actually in:
  ```bash
  uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages
  uv sync --dev
  ```
  `Makefile`'s `sync`/`install` targets and `scripts/setup.sh` do this
  automatically now — `uv sync` alone (without a pre-existing correctly
  configured `.venv`) will silently create a venv that can't see `gi`.

- **`/dev/video48` gets created root-only.** Manually `modprobe`-ing
  `v4l2loopback` without the distro package's udev rule leaves the device
  node as `crw------- root root` — neither a `systemd --user` service nor
  a browser running as a regular user can open it. Fixed by installing a
  udev rule (`GROUP="video", MODE="0660"`) and ensuring the user is in the
  `video` group — both handled by `scripts/setup.sh`. Group membership
  changes require logging out and back in to take effect.

## Useful diagnostic commands

```bash
# Find the sensor's current media-controller entity (bus number can change per boot)
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -p | grep -i ov02c10

# Current sensor control values (exposure, gain, etc.)
v4l2-ctl -d "$(media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -e 'ov02c10 <BUS>-0036')" -l

# Set gain manually for a quick test
v4l2-ctl -d "$(media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -e 'ov02c10 <BUS>-0036')" -c analogue_gain=150,digital_gain=4096

# Confirm whether PSYS is available at all before attempting the proprietary HAL route
lsmod | grep -i ipu6
find /lib/modules/"$(uname -r)" -iname "*ipu6*psys*"
```
